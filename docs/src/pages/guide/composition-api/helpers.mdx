Aside from `useField` and `useForm` and `useFieldArray`, these are a collection of simple functions that you can use to opt-in specific parts of vee-validate features like form state and various actions you can perform on fields and forms.

Here are a few examples of what you can build with these functions:

- A custom submission progress component
- A custom error message component.
- A form validity indicators
- reset buttons or submit buttons

Here is a list of the functions available that you can use:

- `useFieldError` Gives access to a single field's first error message
- `useFormErrors` Gives access to the entire error bag of the form
- `useIsFieldDirty` If a field is dirty
- `useIsFormDirty` If the form is dirty (form contains at least one dirty field)
- `useIsFieldTouched` If a field is touched
- `useIsFormTouched` If the form is touched (form contains at least one touched field)
- `useIsFieldValid` If a field is valid
- `useIsFormValid` If all fields are **validated and valid**
- `useValidateField` Returns a function that validates a specific field
- `useValidateForm` Returns a function that validates the entire form
- `useResetForm` Resets the form to its initial state
- `useSubmitForm` Creates a submission function that validates and submits the form (even if no `form` element is involved)
- `useIsSubmitting` If the form is currently submitting
- `useIsValidating` If the form is currently validating by validate function
- `useSubmitCount` The number of times the user attempted to submit the form
- `useFieldValue` Returns a specific fields' current value
- `useFormValues` Returns the current form field values

For more information about the functions, you can head over to the [API reference and check them out](/api/composition-helpers).
