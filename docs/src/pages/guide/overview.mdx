# Overview

Form validation is a difficult subject in frontend development. Not only do you have to deal with ensuring that correct values are submitted, but you should also provide a pleasant UX for your users.

Doing form validation by hand is a lot of work and you probably won't cover all your needs if you decide to build your own.

**The time you spend working on a custom form validation solution is better spent building your application logic**.

Most validation libraries will save you a lot of time, but `vee-validate` tackles the major pain points of form validation and addresses them in a very flexible way:

- Tracking form state
- UI and UX
- Synchronous and Asynchronous Validation
- Handling submissions

By only handling the complex stuff, vee-validate gets out of your way of building your awesome forms.

## Getting Started

vee-validate makes use of two flavors to add validation to your forms.

The first approach is using higher-order components (HOC) to validate your fields. In the next examples you will find the `Field`, `Form`, and `ErrorMessage` components being used.

The second flavor is using the composition API to add validation logic into your existing components. You will be using `useField` and `useForm` to validate your fields and data.

Whichever approach you prefer to use, both flavors can be used interchangeably. So you can mix and match between the two approaches as needed.

Most examples in the docs use the new [script setup](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#script-setup) SFC syntax for brevity. if you found trouble following along, make sure to review it.

### Using a package manager

For a more modern workflow with a bundler, you can install vee-validate using a package manager like `yarn`, `npm` or `pnpm`:

```sh
yarn add vee-validate
# or
npm i vee-validate --save
# or
pnpm add vee-validate
```

### Using a script tag

You can use vee-validate with a script tag and a CDN, import the library like this:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vee-validate"></script>
```

This will inject a `VeeValidate` global object, which you will use to access the various components and functions exposed by vee-validate.
